## STEP BY STEP APPROACH

### STEP 1: Identify Q's Types

*   Open the <.docx> FILE in editing mode and mark each Question on the basis of their types.


* You can also convert <.docx> into <.pdf> for easily marking or colour coding the types for identification.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><h4>Type 1 (T1)</h4><p>Simple - Straightforward</p></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Type 2 (T2)</h4><p>Consider the following </p></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Type 3(T3)</h4><p>Match the Correct Pairs</p></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### STEP 2: Arrange Qs in format: T1-> T2-> T3

#### Find all T2  Types and Take them towards the end of FILE

#### Find all T3  Types and Take them towards the end of FILE

At this Point, all our Questions are arranged in the T1-> T2-> T3 style but their Question Numbers are unordered and we need to fix this.

### STEP 3:  Correct the Sequence of Question No. Markings

* Delete Old Unorganised Question Number Markings.
* ADD New Question Numbers starting from 1 to 100.

ATTENTION: If you find duplicate Questions or Missing Questions (All total must be 100) While arranging Questions and Adding New numbers, immediately report to the MANTAVYAM TEAM to get this fixed.
{% endhint %}

At this point, we've a properly arranged and ordered document which we'll use for our final edits.

### STEP 4: Find Answers and Cross Verify Them

* Highlighted Coloured Text in the Options is the Correct Answer to that particular Question.
* Record Answers to all Questions :

Create a Separate <.docx> or note down with a pen-paper or use the img below to mark on it.
