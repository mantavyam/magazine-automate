<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of All Tabs Opened</p></figcaption></figure>

## STEP 2: File Formatting

### Insert Table of Content:

#### Open All Newsletter Files One by One and Do the following Tasks

1. Convert Newsletter Date mentioned at Top into TITLE (text type).
2. Insert Table of Content as Plain Text.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Insert Table of Content </p></figcaption></figure>

Click on the "Table of Content", you'll see refresh icon & **3 dots** on top left corner.

Click on the three dots > More Options

* Under **Formatting:** Turn off "Show Page Numbers"
* Under **Heading Levels:** Turn off "Heading 1"

Once you're done inserting Table of Content as instructed above in all Newsletters, Copy these "table of contents" and paste them into their respective dates under TIMELINE in the **WEEKLY-RAW-FILE.**

### Shorten Timeline /w AI

```
I'm going to give you some news headlines, your task is to make them short like someone who has read the content can quickly know what the topic was about. 
for example:
SEBI introduces Framework for Stock Exchanges to supervise RAs & Ias

you'll make it short like this:
SEBI's Framework for supervision

THUMB RULE: Make it in max 5-6 words
no need to provide numbering or bullet formatting

ADDITIONALLY: You can use indentation methods like introduce ":" to mean for and more such short techniques.

any questions or ready to receive?
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If AI gives bad responses, Start Over again by resending the prompt in a new chat.
{% endhint %}

### Insert Highlights

After all timeline content is shortened with AI , we'll add Highlights.

From all Dates under TIMELINE, pick any 2 or 3 lines randomly and insert them under HIGHLIGHTS.

### Insert Dates in all Categories

Right after the Categories, Insert the date of respective Newsletter file date for quick identification of content during designing phase of weekly-compilation.

### Insert MCQs into Weekly-RAW

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Date Wise Arrange all MCQ Tables</p></figcaption></figure>

### Insert Main Content: Date Wise

We'll now exclude the "MCQ table" and "Table of Content" and copy everything from the **Newsletter-Docs File** and insert it under **ASCENDING ARRANGEMENT** topic in **Weekly-Docs File** below it's respective Newsletter Date.&#x20;
