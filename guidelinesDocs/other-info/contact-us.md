### What if there are any other challenges?

We've included all possible scenarios from our editor's experience and explained them for each topic in all sections. You can also view them in video format in the folder shared with you. If still there's any other challenge where you're unable to figure out the possible outcome, you're always welcome to make a quick reference note of all unresolved challenges and forward them to our mail at below address. After forwarding the unresolved challenges, you can continue with remaining edits without waiting for the response from our side, as we'll reply possibly within 24Hrs during that time you can accomplish other tasks which you know "how to do". **Remember the motto is: Do What you know first, Other Things will be figured out.**
